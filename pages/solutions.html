                        This system allows animals to continue walking and living- with zero disruption. It also allows humans to be able to continue driving without any disruptions. Effectively this design has the least effect on both wildlife and humans- making it one of the most usable methods to help reduce accidents. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        This design is typically used in collaboration with electric fences to help the animals remain on the overpass. In a region that suffers from 60% of the accidents being in collision with wildlife, it is expected to reduce accidents of the sort by 85%.

                        Wildlife fences are a bit different from general human electric fences. These fences are designed to repel both overhead and underground trespassing- anticipating both digging animals and large game. It has a reinforced bottom to stop animals from leaving the pass from underneath- and an ex trended electrified to prevent large animals from breaking it down or climbing over.

                    <p>This system detects animals that are near the road and warns oncoming vehicles of these animals before a collision could happen. This doesn’t stop cars from moving or animals form crossing- so it still is the responsibility of the driver to avoid the accident and be aware. Another flaw with this is that it doesn’t control the movement and behavior of the animal- which won’t cause a problem most of the time. However with larger game like moose and bears, this can cause a hazard for people on the road if the animal chooses to stay on the road or engage with cars.

                        Wildlife mats are large, electrified mats are used to keep wildlife off areas that cannot be fenced off, such as fence openings or highway entrances and exits. The wildlife mat releases a small electric shock that redirects animals away from a location that they should not enter. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        It can be used on roads, driveways, and general gaps in fencing and walls. These wildlife mats are typically used with wildlife fences to cover areas the fence cannot cover. It also is used with the wildlife overpass to protect certain areas as well.
