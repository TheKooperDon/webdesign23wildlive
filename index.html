                    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                    <h3>Animals Lives Matter</h3>
                    <p>The number of accidents and collisions we see per year between wildlife and vehicles is alarming-
                        and tends to be an afterthought. How many times did you drive down a local road and see a dead
                        animal or “roadkill” laying on road as vehicles pound by without stopping. That animal was
                        trying to reach his family on the other side, or locate food, or try and reach water- but was
                        not aware of the dangers of a human road. Animals do not understand what this area is meant for-
                        and cannot comprehend that it is dangerous. It is our responsibility as humans to ensure their
                        safety and our own- as we are the ones who set up this system. We cannot rely on animals to
                        understand the system that we built.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1-2 million collisions happen yearly between animals and cars- and that rate has been increasing
                        exponentially since recent innovations in the world of automobiles have made them more durable
                        and more deadly- causing the number of accidents to increase by 50% between 1990 & 2004. The
                        problem is not going away- in fact, it is getting worse and worse. And it is exacerbated by the
                        constant growth of American towns and cities- overlapping with more wildlife. If this issue is
                        not solved or reduced- the numbers tell us that it will only get worse from here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contrary to initial thought- these collisions do not only hurt animals; they also cause injury
                        or death among humans. Accounting for about 12,000 human injuries per year- and 150 fatalities.
                        If you are not concerned about the animals being harmed or the cars being damaged- surely you
                        would care about the safety of humans. With the high rate of collisions only going higher- the
                        number of injuries, deaths, and damaged cars will only go higher as well. It is time that we as
                        humans became more proactive in finding a solution to this issue.
